## Getting Started
## Inspiration
Technology is rapidly advancing but the way we teach has stayed pretty stagnantâ€¦
Professors often struggle teaching while referring to information from their lecture formats, this tool provides a medium for them to lecture efficiently and transcribe information accurately. 
## What it does
Profjector is a tool that enables professors to upload their teaching content into the virtual space and interact with them. Allowing for interactive, efficient and seamless lectures. 
## How we built it
We built this project primarily with Snap Lens. 
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into issues rendering and projecting meshes on flat surfaces. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Multi-page navigation and resizing. 
## What we learned
We learned to get creative with our limitations and utilize pre-existing tools to save time and focus on important implementation. 
## What's next for Profjector?
Profjector is a tool that enables professors to upload their teaching content into the virtual space and interact with them. Allowing for interactive, efficient and seamless lectures.
