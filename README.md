## Getting Started  
Education is at a turning point. While technology is evolving rapidly, the tools we use to teach—especially in traditional classroom settings—have largely remained the same. We set out to explore how we could use immersive technology to make lectures more interactive, intuitive, and dynamic.

## Inspiration  
Professors often face the challenge of balancing live teaching with the need to reference and display content. Traditional slide decks and lecture notes don’t always align with the flow of a lecture, making it harder to keep students engaged. We envisioned a tool that would bridge this gap—one that lets instructors *project*, *interact with*, and *manipulate* their content in a 3D environment.  

## What it does  
**Profjector** is an augmented reality tool that enables professors to upload and interact with their teaching materials in virtual space. With it, they can navigate through content with intuitive gestures, resize or reposition slides, and present multiple pages seamlessly—turning any flat surface into an immersive teaching experience. It’s like having a smart whiteboard that follows your lead and adapts to your teaching style.

## How we built it  
We developed Profjector using **Snap Lens Studio**, leveraging its AR capabilities to project educational content into real-world environments. By combining Snap’s surface tracking and image manipulation features, we created a smooth and responsive experience for both presentation and interaction.

## Challenges we ran into  
One of the main technical challenges we faced was **accurately rendering and projecting mesh objects onto flat surfaces** without visual distortion. We also had to find creative solutions to optimize performance within Snap Lens Studio's constraints, especially when handling multi-page navigation and interactive resizing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of  
We’re especially proud of implementing **multi-page navigation and dynamic resizing**, which allow for more flexibility and control during lectures. These features make it easy for professors to adapt their presentation style on the fly.

## What we learned  
We learned how to **get creative with limitations**, using pre-existing tools and frameworks to save time and focus our energy on what really mattered—creating an engaging and functional user experience. Working with Snap Lens taught us a lot about balancing user interaction with technical feasibility in AR environments.

## What's next for Profjector?  
We plan to expand Profjector by integrating **voice commands, real-time annotations, and collaborative features** for students. Our goal is to create a complete AR-powered lecture toolkit that enhances both teaching and learning—making classrooms more immersive, accessible, and future-ready.
